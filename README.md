# Digital-Thermometer-Using-PIC16F887-Microcontroller
The Digital Thermometer project using a PIC16F887 microcontroller, LM35 sensor, toggle switch, UART, and LCD is a simple system that shows the temperature on a screen. The LM35 sensor measures the room temperature and sends that information as a small voltage to the PIC16F887. The microcontroller reads this signal, converts it into a temperature value, and shows it on the LCD display. A toggle switch can be used to turn the system on or off, or to switch between showing temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit. The UART is used to send the temperature data to a computer or another device if needed.
